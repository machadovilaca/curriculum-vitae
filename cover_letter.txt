I have 3 years of professional experience as a Software Engineer. I have been
working at Red Hat for 1 year, where I am a part of Kubevirt's
Hyperconverged Cluster Operator team. I have also worked as a DevOps Engineer at
Public Mint, where I developed a platform for a payment system that aims to
reduce fees for worldwide transfers through cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

I have a strong technical background and I am very passionate about software
development and new technologies. I have a good understanding of distributed
systems, virtualization, and containers. I am also familiar with a wide range of
programming languages and frameworks, such as Golang, Java, JavaScript, and Ruby
on Rails.

I completed my Master's Degree in Software Engineering in 2022, at the
University of Minho. I was class delegate and was elected for several positions
at CeSIUM, my courses students center, such as Treasurer and Vice-President.
There I developed a vast range of skills and participated in a lot of projects,
from developing platforms and websites, organizing tech conferences, managing
social networks, and managing the treasury of the organization.

I am a team player and I have good communication skills. I am proactive and I
always try to find the best solution to the problem at hand. I am also a fast
learner and I am always willing to learn new things.
